Description: 
    This package offers a collection of algorithms to solve the Maximum Subarray 
    Problem (MSP) for both 1D arrays (e.g., Kadane's algorithm, divide-and-conquer) 
    and 2D matrices (e.g., extended brute-force or optimized methods), with 
    implementations in pure R and C++ for performance comparison. Users can benchmark 
    runtime efficiency across different approaches (from naive to optimal) and problem 
    sizes, making it useful for both practical applications (e.g., data analysis) and 
    algorithmic education.
