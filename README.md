The goal of MaximumSubarray is to find the contiguous subarray (or submatrix) within a one-dimensional or two-dimensional array of numbers (which may include negatives) that has the largest possible sum.

 - In the 1D case, the goal is to identify a contiguous segment of the array with the maximum sum.

 - In the 2D case, the objective is to find a rectangular submatrix (i.e., a block of contiguous rows and columns) whose elements yield the largest sum.

These problems are useful in various applications such as time-series analysis, image processing, and optimization tasks where identifying the "best-performing" segment or region is essential.
This Package provides different type of algorithms and implementation in R or C++ to resolve the maximum subarray problem with the possibility to compare between them based time complexity.
